# why we study algorithms ?

**simple programming problems**
- linear scan
- can not do much better
- solution is obvious

**Standard programming problems**
1. Find the best pairing of students and dorm rooms
2. Find the shortest path to reach the destination

If we solve these problems ourselves, there is always a room for optimisation. These problems are generally math problems indirectly.
It will be a non-trivial result.

**Artificial Intelligence problems**
1. Natural language processing
2. Identify the objects in photograph
3. Play games

Its hard to clear state the problem.

### Two algorithm problems: 
We will cover the two basic algorithm problems:
- Fibonaci numbers
- Greatest common divisors

##### Fibonaci Numbers
<code>Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 , n > 1</code>

It was used to estimate rabbit population. How to calculate nth fibonaci number?

**Running time - why is it so slow ?**

Using the naive algorithm, will take a long time to evaulate. As we have a big recursive tree to find the number.

##### Greatest Common Divisor

GCD of 2 numbers, a and b, is defined as the largest number that divides both a and b.
